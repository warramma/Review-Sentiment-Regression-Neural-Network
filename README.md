# Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network
Predicting review sentiment as positive (true or false) using logistic regression and neural network
# Overview
The project's goal is to predict the sentiment of book reviews, classifying them as either positive or negative. The project follows the complete machine learning lifecycle, from data selection and exploratory data analysis to model implementation, evaluation, and optimization.
The two models explored in this project are Logistic Regression & Neural Network
# Objectives & Goals
The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given book review.

The specific goals are:
- Select and prepare a suitable dataset: Choose one of the provided datasets and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Define a clear ML problem: Formulate a supervised learning problem for sentiment classification.
- Implement and compare two models: Train and evaluate both a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network.
- Optimize model performance: Tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their accuracy and generalization.
- Document the process: Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the steps taken, from data preparation to final results.
